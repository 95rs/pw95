# pw95
A [Windows 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95) style window in [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) with [React](https://react.dev/) and [React95](https://react95.io).

## Tauri + React + Typescript + React95

This template should help get you started developing with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), [React](https://react.dev/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) in [Vite](https://vite.dev/) in a [Windows 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95) style.

## Recommended IDE Setup
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (you can use the [insiders version](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) if you want)
- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and the [Tauri extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and the [rust-analyzer extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
- [Pretty TypeScript Errors VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yoavbls.pretty-ts-errors)

## What comes in it? (features)
- Icons using [Octicons](https://primer.style/foundations/icons) and [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com)
- A working close button for the whole app on the window (using [Octicons](https://primer.style/foundations/icons) for the icon)
- Display any component in [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) (recommended to stick to just the [React95 styled-components](https://storybook.react95.io/?path=/story/docs-welcome-to-react95--page))
- Responsive [React95 window focus and non-focus](https://storybook.react95.io/?path=/story/environment-window--default) (changing the style of the [window using the active property when focussed or non-focussed](https://storybook.react95.io/?path=/story/environment-window--default))

## Demo:
It's recommended to see what this projects output will be like on your computer before using.

For a demo run these steps:
- For Windows:
    - Download the Windows x64 `.msi` or `.exe` installer file from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/95rs/pw95/releases).
- For Linux:
    - Not available at the moment.
- For MacOS:
    - Will not be made at all. See disclamers at the bottom of the readme for more info.


## Get started using this:
> [!WARNING]
> You will need to change the `YOUR_USERNAME` bit in the URL of cloning the project fork command.

1. Fork this project by going to the [fork page](https://github.com/95rs/pw95/fork)
2. Clone the fork using: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pw95.git`
3. Open the src/pw95 dir using: `cd src/pw95`
4. Install the dependencies using [npm](https://npmjs.com): `npm install`
5. Run the project using: `npm run tauri dev`

Done in 5 simple steps.. How easy was that.
Now you can edit the files to how you would want your program to look and function.

## Disclamers:
- MacOS support will not be made at all.
    - I will not add MacOS at all and if you want to use it then you will need to build it yourself.

- Any errors have to be submitted to the [issues tab](https://github.com/95rs/pw95/issues).
    - Any where else apart from the [issues tab](https://github.com/95rs/pw95/issues) and the [pull requests tab](https://github.com/95rs/pw95/pulls) will not be fixed.
